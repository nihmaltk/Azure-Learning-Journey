## What is Cloud?
Think of the **cloud** as a powerful computer that lives on the internet. You can use it to:
- Store files
- Run apps
- Use services (like Gmail or Google Drive)

You don't need to manage the hardware. You just access everything over the internet — from anywhere, anytime.

**Real-World Example:**
Using Google Drive to store documents instead of keeping them on a USB drive.

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing means delivering **computing services (like servers, databases, apps, and storage)** over the internet instead of maintaining your own machines.

You can:
- Use third-party providers (like Microsoft Azure or AWS) = **Public Cloud**
- Use your own on-premises servers = **Private Cloud**
- Use both = **Hybrid Cloud**

**Real-World Example:**
A startup hosts its website on Azure (public cloud) but keeps sensitive customer data in its private server (private cloud).

## Public, Private & Hybrid Cloud

| Cloud Type     | Who Uses It  | What It’s Like                            | Example                                      |
|----------------|------------- |------------------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------- |
| **Public**     | Anyone       | Shared space on the internet              | Google Drive, AWS, Azure                     |
| **Private**    | One org      | Personal digital clubhouse                | Company’s own data center                    |
| **Hybrid**     | Both         | Mix of personal & shared spaces           | Sensitive data in private, website on public |

**Summary:**
- **Public Cloud** = Shared for all
- **Private Cloud** = Just for you
- **Hybrid Cloud** = Best of both worlds

## Key Concepts in Cloud Computing

## Virtualization
Turning one physical machine into **multiple virtual ones**.

**Example:** Like dividing a big house into small apartments, each working independently.

## Virtual Machine (VM)
A **software-based computer** that runs inside a physical one. You can run Windows and Linux at the same time on one machine using VMs.

## API (Application Programming Interface)
An API lets two different apps or systems **talk to each other**.

**Example:** A food delivery app uses APIs to talk to maps, payment systems, and restaurant databases.

## Regions
**Geographic locations** where cloud providers (like Azure) have data centers.

**Example:** "Central India" or "East US"

## Availability Zones
**Separate data centers** within a region. If one fails, others keep running. Each has its own power and networking.

## Scalability
The system's ability to **grow** as demand increases.

**Example:** Adding more servers during an online shopping sale.

## Elasticity
The ability to **automatically scale** resources up/down based on need.

**Example:** Shrinking your app's resources when traffic is low.

## Agility
Being able to **quickly adapt and deploy** resources or applications.

**Example:** Launching a test app in minutes on Azure instead of buying hardware.

## High Availability (HA)
Making sure your app is **up and running almost all the time** (e.g., 99.9%).

## Fault Tolerance
If part of your system fails, it still works.

**Example:** If one server goes down, others take over automatically.

## Disaster Recovery
A **backup plan** to recover data after natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or system failures.

## Load Balancing
Spreads the workload **across multiple servers** so none get overwhelmed.

**Example:** Directing web traffic evenly so your app stays fast and stable.
