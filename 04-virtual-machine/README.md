## What is Virtualization?

**Virtualization** means running multiple virtual computers (called VMs) on a single physical machine. Each VM works like an independent computer with its own OS and apps.

**Real-world example:** Like dividing a single house into multiple apartments. Everyone has their own space, but shares the same building.

## Key Parts of Virtualization

- **Hypervisor:** Software that lets you create and manage VMs.
  - **Type 1 (bare-metal):** Runs directly on hardware (e.g., Hyper-V, VMware ESXi)
  - **Type 2 (hosted):** Runs inside another OS (e.g., VirtualBox)

- **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Virtual computers created by the hypervisor, each with its own virtual CPU, memory, disk, etc.

## Virtualization Concepts (With Examples)

| Concept                   | Meaning                               | Example                                      |
|-------------------------- |-------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------------- |
| **Server Virtualization** | One physical server runs multiple VMs | One office building with multiple businesses |
| **Resource Pooling**      | Sharing CPU, RAM, etc. among VMs      | Shared kitchen for roommates                 |
| **Isolation**             | Each VM runs separately               | One messy room doesn't affect others         |
| **Snapshotting**          | Save current VM state                 | Like taking a backup photo of your room      |
| **Cloning**               | Duplicate a VM                        | Copying one room setup for a new person      |

## Benefits of Virtualization

- **Saves money:** Fewer physical machines needed
- **Flexible:** Easy to create, scale, delete VMs
- **Recovery:** Restore from snapshots
- **Better resource usage:** Use full potential of CPU/RAM
- **Testing:** Safe space to test apps or settings

## Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

VMs in Azure are cloud-based virtual computers. You can run apps, websites, or databases just like a real physical computer.

## Types of Azure VMs (Simplified Table)

| Type                  | Description                        | Use Case                |
|---------------------- |----------------------------------- |------------------------ |
| **General Purpose**   | Balanced CPU and memory            | Dev/test, websites      |
| **Compute Optimized** | High CPU power                     | Analytics, gaming       |
| **Memory Optimized**  | High RAM                           | Big databases, caching  |
| **Storage Optimized** | High disk speed                    | Big data, warehouses    |
| **GPU VMs**           | Has GPUs for graphics/ML           | ML, rendering           |
| **HPC VMs**           | For supercomputing                 | Simulations, modeling   |
| **Burstable**         | Light tasks with occasional spikes | Small websites, testing |

## Creating a VM in Azure (Steps)

1. Go to **Azure Portal**
2. Click **"Create a Resource" → Virtual Machine**
3. Enter VM details (name, OS, size, region)
4. Choose login method (password/SSH)
5. Click **"Review + Create" → Create**

## Connecting to Azure VM

- **Windows VM:** Use Remote Desktop (RDP)
- **Linux VM:** Use SSH (via terminal)
- Use the **Public IP** provided by Azure to connect.

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

**VM Scale Set** = A group of VMs that automatically **scale up or down** based on traffic/workload.

**Example:** During a sale, your website gets more traffic. VMSS adds more VMs to handle the load. After traffic goes down, it removes extra VMs to save cost.

**Summary:**
- Virtualization lets you run many virtual machines on one server.
- Azure provides many types of VMs for different needs.
- You can connect, deploy apps, and scale VMs based on traffic using VMSS.

These concepts are essential for managing infrastructure in the cloud.
