## What Are Azure Storage Services?
Azure Storage Services let you **store data in the cloud**. You can store anything from **files, images, videos, backups, logs, messages, and databases**. Microsoft Azure gives you different types of storage based on your needs.

## **Why Use Azure Storage?**

- **Scalable:** Easily store a small file or petabytes of data.
- **Secure:** Built-in encryption and access control.
- **Durable:** Your data is safely backed up across Azure data centers.
- **Accessible:** Access data from anywhere using the internet.
- **Cost-effective:** Pay only for what you use.

## Azure **Blob Storage(Container)**

**What is it?**
- Used for storing **unstructured data** (images, videos, documents, backups).
- Data is stored in **containers**, and each file is a **blob**.

**When to use?**
- Hosting images/videos for a website.
- Storing backups, logs, or big data for analytics.

**Example:** Upload product images for an e-commerce site.

## Azure **File Storage**

**What is it?**
- A **shared cloud file system** like a network drive.
- Uses **SMB protocol**, so you can mount it on Windows/Linux.

**When to use?**
- When multiple virtual machines need to share files.
- Useful for shared configuration files or reports.

**Example:** Store shared documents used by multiple apps.

## Azure **Table Storage**

**What is it?**
- A **NoSQL key-value** store for **semi-structured data**.
- Doesn't require a fixed schema like SQL.

**When to use?**
- Store scalable data like user profiles or app settings.

**Example:** Store IoT device data or app configuration info.

## Azure **Queue Storage**

**What is it?**
- A **message queue** to let different app parts talk asynchronously.
- Stores and forwards messages reliably.

**When to use?**
- Letting different parts of an app talk to each other without being directly connected.
- For background tasks like email processing.

**Example:** When a user uploads a file, a message is queued for another service to process it.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Blob Storage**        | Images, videos, backups                  | Uploading profile pictures                  |
| **File Storage**        | Shared access for VMs/apps               | Shared folder for logs/configs              |
| **Table Storage**       | NoSQL key-value semi-structured data     | Storing user settings                       |
| **Queue Storage**       | Messaging between app parts              | Task queue for image processing             |

These storage services are key to **building flexible, scalable, and reliable applications** in the Azure cloud.
