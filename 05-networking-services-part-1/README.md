## Overview
Azure Networking allows cloud resources to communicate securely, both internally and with the internet or on-premise systems. It functions like a private, well-managed city of connected resources.

## Virtual Network (VNet)

A **Virtual Network (VNet)** is a private, logically isolated network in Azure.
- Acts like a **private neighborhood**.
- Enables Azure services (VMs, databases, etc.) to securely communicate.
- Can connect to other VNets or on-premise systems.

**Example:** Use a VNet to isolate backend resources from public access.

## Subnets
- **Subnets** are subdivisions of a VNet.
- Help organize and control traffic between resources.

**Example:** Separate web servers and databases into different subnets.

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
- CIDR defines IP address ranges.

**Example:** `10.0.0.0/16` allows addresses from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.255.255`.

## Routes
- Define traffic paths (like road directions).
- Specify destination and next hop.

## Route Tables
- Collections of routes.
- Attached to subnets to manage traffic flow.

**Example:** Redirect traffic through a firewall using custom routes.

## Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- **NSGs** are firewalls that allow or deny traffic.
- Rules based on IP, port, protocol.

**Key Features:**
- Inbound/outbound rules.
- Can attach to subnets or individual VM interfaces.

**Example:** Block internet access to a database, allow only internal access.

## Application Security Groups (ASGs)
- Group VMs based on roles.
- Simplify NSG rules using ASG names instead of IPs.

**Benefits:**
- Easier to manage as VMs change.
- Dynamic rule application.

**Example:** Group all frontend servers and allow access to backend group only.
